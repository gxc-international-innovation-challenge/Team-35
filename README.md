#### Welcome to the Repository of the Team 35 - aka Power to the Youngsters(PTY)


## Who are we?

We are Team 35, we have worked on the challenge given by the Munich District Youth Association - Kreisjugendring München: 

**"The future of youth participation: how to empower the youngsters?"**

## Why do we want this?

Through the guidance of Hochschsule Muenchen's course, sponsors, and challenge givers, PTY' innovation stems from design thinking methods, observing interviewing, synthesizing, ideation, prototyping, testing, and feedback. This process cultivated new insights and prototypes that aim to help youth users with community activism.

## What is our Solution ? 

"OurVoice" is a digital hub encouraging young people (14-25) to get involved in local civic issues on a global scale. Considering that social disparities and injustices revealed during COVID-19, youth are revolutionizing digital activism and awaken their drive to make a difference in their community and future. PTY startup developed “OurVoice” —an app that bridges youngsters around the world through social justice groups, resources, and strategies to mobilize change in their local communities.

## What is our Mission? 

To promote a new form of engagement by bringing youngsters and change-makers together to take actions in a world that needs it.
